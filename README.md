# British Airways Machine Learning Project

### Plan: 
We need a "proactive" approach to acquiring customers before they embark on their holiday. 
- A data PREDICTIVE model
- y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ...

### Method: 
- Build a predictive model
- Use Machine Learning to train it
- Evaluate the model’s performance and output how each variable contributes to the predictive model’s power.
- Interpret results to measure the model's predictive effectiveness

## Target: 
Predict the target outcome (customers buying holidays).
